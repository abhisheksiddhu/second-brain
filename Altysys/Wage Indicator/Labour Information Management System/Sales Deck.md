Slide 1 — The Problem Most Government Platforms Face 

Title: From Portal to Platform: The Missing Evolution in Government Systems 

Message: 

Most national employment / citizen service platforms are built as: 

Job portals or information websites 

Siloed systems with poor data quality 

Limited integrations with other government systems 

No AI, no analytics, no personalization 

Weak infrastructure, security, and monitoring 

Low adoption and limited stakeholder trust 

Result: 
A system that exists… but does not drive outcomes, insights, or policy intelligence. 

Shape 

Slide 2 — What Global Best Systems Do Differently 

Title: What a World-Class National Platform Actually Looks Like 

Globally successful systems are not portals. They are: 

Data Platform + AI Platform + Interoperable Government Platform + Citizen Services Platform + Policy Intelligence Platform 

They are built to be: 

Relevant (rich, trusted data) 

Reliable (secure, always available) 

Efficient (AI and automation driven) 

Citizen-centric (UX, personalization, accessibility) 

Comprehensive (connected to entire ecosystem) 

Shape 

Slide 3 — The 10 Building Blocks of an Advanced National Platform 

Title: The Framework for an Advanced Labor Market Information System (LMIS) 

A mature platform is built on: 

Data Collection 

Data Validation 

Accessibility & UX 

Targeted Service Delivery 

Strategic Adoption & Marketing 

Interoperability with other systems 

Strong operating & governance model 

Technical Infrastructure & Cloud readiness 

Data Management & Master Data 

Information Security 

This is a full digital transformation program, not a portal upgrade. 

Shape 

Slide 4 — Typical Gaps Seen in Existing Systems 

Title: Where Most Government Platforms Struggle 

Common patterns we observe: 

Free-text data → unusable for analytics or AI 

Manual verification and low data trust 

No AI-driven matching or recommendations 

No integration with training, welfare, education, insurance systems 

No disaster recovery or monitoring framework 

Limited security maturity 

Poor mobile and user experience 

No analytics for decision makers 

No adoption, training, or engagement strategy 

Very small tech teams managing national platforms 

Shape

Provides AI-driven job and skill matching 

Offers personalized services for different user groups 

Generates labor market intelligence for policy decisions 

Operates on secure, scalable cloud infrastructure 

Integrates seamlessly with public and private systems 

Drives high adoption through usability and outreach

Transforming Government Portals into AI-Powered, Interoperable, Citizen-Centric Digital Platforms 

Shape 

The Challenge Governments Commonly Face 

Across countries, many national employment and citizen service platforms were built as information portals or job boards. Over time, they struggle with: 

Fragmented and poor-quality data 

Limited integration with other government systems 

Manual verification and low data trust 

Lack of AI, analytics, and personalization 

Weak infrastructure, monitoring, and disaster recovery 

Security gaps and compliance risks 

Low adoption by citizens, employers, and field officers 

Minimal ability to generate insights for policy makers 

As a result, these systems exist, but do not deliver measurable impact for citizens, employers, or government decision makers. 

Shape 

What a World-Class National Platform Looks Like 

Global best practices show that successful systems are not portals. They are: 

Data Platforms + AI Platforms + Interoperable Government Platforms + Citizen Services Platforms + Policy Intelligence Platforms 

They are designed to be: 

Relevant – built on rich, trustworthy, multi-source data 

Reliable – secure, always available, and scalable 

Efficient – driven by automation and AI 

Citizen-centric – intuitive, personalized, accessible 

Comprehensive – connected to the broader ecosystem of education, welfare, skilling, and employment systems 

Shape
