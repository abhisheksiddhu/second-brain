1️⃣ The Core Message of the Report (the one line) 

Most countries think they are building a job portal. 
World-class countries actually build a national labor intelligence platform. 

That’s the entire thesis. 

Indonesia thought it had an LMIS. World Bank proved it only had a basic job website. 

Shape 

2️⃣ Why LMIS matters (business + policy angle you can use) 

Labor market failures happen because: 

Job seekers don’t know what skills are in demand 

Employers don’t know where talent is 

Education system trains for the wrong skills 

Government cannot design policy because no real data 

Result: skills mismatch, unemployment, low productivity, bad policy. 

👉 An LMIS is meant to fix information failure in the economy. 

This is a powerful line in sales conversations. 

Shape 

3️⃣ The Big Insight: LMIS is NOT a portal 

The report introduces a framework: 

A real LMIS = 

Data System + AI System + Integration System + Citizen Service System + Policy Intelligence System 

Most governments build only: 

❌ Job portal with vacancies 

Shape 

4️⃣ The 10 Building Blocks of a Real LMIS (this is gold for you) 

The report says a proper LMIS must be strong in: 

Data collection (from many sources, not only portal) 

Data validation (trustworthy data) 

UX & accessibility (citizen centric) 

Targeted services (youth, SMEs, vulnerable, etc.) 

Marketing & adoption (yes, marketing!) 

Interoperability with other govt systems 

Skilled human resources to run it 

Technical infra (cloud, DR, monitoring) 

Data management & MDM 

Information security 

You can literally turn this into an assessment checklist for prospects.

5️⃣ The Benchmark: Korea Work-net vs Indonesia AyoKitaKerja 

This is the heart of the report. 

Indonesia had: 

AyoKitaKerja – a job portal 

Korea had: 

Work-net – a full ecosystem platform 

Biggest differences you should talk about: 

Area 

Korea (Advanced LMIS) 

Indonesia (Basic Portal) 

Vacancies 

Pulled from firms, portals, govt, partners 

Only what companies post 

Job Seekers 

Mandatory registration for benefits 

Very small % of workforce 

Validation 

4-step automated + human validation 

Manual, rare 

UX 

Mobile app, personalized, unified login 

Basic web 

Integrations 

Education, welfare, insurance, training 

None 

AI 

Matching, profiling, forecasting 

None 

Support 

24/7 call center, feedback 

None 

HR team 

Marketing team, research team, counselors 

4 people running it 

Infra 

DR, backup, redundancy 

None 

Data quality 

MDM, standards, checks 

None 

Security 

Full security framework 

Firewall only 

Functions 

Career guidance, training link, policy analytics 

Only job search 

This table is exactly what prospects don’t realize about their own system. 

Shape 

6️⃣ Very important concept from report: “Critical Mass of Data” 

The report repeatedly says: 

If your platform does not have a large % of employers and job seekers, 
it is useless for analytics, AI, or policy. 

This is a killer consulting insight. 

So LMIS success depends on: 

Adoption strategy 

Partnerships 

Integration 

Not just technology 

Shape 

7️⃣ 5 Characteristics of a World-Class LMIS (memorize these) 

You can use these as maturity pillars: 

Relevance – rich, multi-source trusted data 

Reliability – secure, always available, DR, infra 

Efficiency – AI, automation, monitoring 

Client at center – UX, personalization, feedback 

Comprehensiveness – connected to education, welfare, training, policy 

Any prospect’s system will fail in 3–4 of these. 

Shape 

8️⃣ What Indonesia got wrong (this is what many govts are doing today) 

Built portal, not platform 

No integrations 

No AI 

No data standards 

No data validation 

No adoption strategy 

No research / analytics team 

No infra resilience 

No mobile / UX thinking 

No linkage to training & education 

Sound familiar? It will to your prospects. 

Shape 

9️⃣ The Recommended Roadmap (you can reuse this in proposals) 

Phase 1 – Fix the foundation 

Cloud, DR, monitoring 

Data quality & structured templates 

Security 

UX redesign 

AI matching 

Phase 2 – Intelligence 

Personalized services 

Dashboards for govt 

Integrations with programs 

Career guidance tools 

Phase 3 – Ecosystem 

Education, welfare, insurance, skilling integration 

Labor market analytics & forecasting 

Private portal partnerships 

This is literally a 3-year transformation program. 

Shape 

🔟 The biggest takeaway you can tell a prospect 

“If you are planning to build an LMIS, and you are starting with a portal, you are repeating Indonesia’s mistake. 
You need to design it as a data + AI + integration platform from day one.” 

That line lands very well.

How you can position Altysys using this report 

You can say: 

World Bank identified 10 capability areas required for LMIS maturity. 
Altysys works exactly across those 10 areas — data, AI, integration, cloud, UX, security, governance. 

You are no longer pitching services. 
You are pitching LMIS transformation maturity.
