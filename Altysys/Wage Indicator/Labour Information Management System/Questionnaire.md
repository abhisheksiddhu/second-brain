Love this part. This is where you move from vendor to advisor in 15 minutes. 

Use this as a live diagnostic in your first meeting. 
You don’t present it as a checklist. You ask it conversationally. 

Score mentally: 

Yes / Strong = 2 

Partial = 1 

No = 0 

At the end, you can literally tell them their LMIS maturity level.

🧭 LMIS / LIMS Maturity Diagnostic (15-Minute Conversation Tool) 

Section 1 — Data Foundation (most fail here) 

Do you collect vacancy data only from employers posting on your portal, or from multiple sources (private portals, govt systems, partners)? 

Is your job seeker and employer data in structured format (dropdowns, standards) or mostly free text? 

Do you have any automated data validation or verification workflow? 

Do you have a central data repository / data lake for analytics? 

Can you confidently say your data is trusted for policy or analytics? 

Shape 

Section 2 — Adoption & Critical Mass (the silent killer) 

What % of national employers are registered on the platform? 

What % of workforce / job seekers are registered? 

Do you have any marketing, outreach, or partnership strategy to increase adoption? 

Is registration linked to any government benefit, scheme, or mandate? 

Shape 

Section 3 — Intelligence & AI 

Do you have any AI-based job matching or recommendations? 

Can the system suggest skills, training, or career paths to users? 

Do you generate dashboards or labor market analytics for decision makers? 

Can you forecast skill demand or employment trends from your data? 

Shape 

Section 4 — Integrations (where real LMIS becomes powerful) 

Is your system integrated with education / skilling systems? 

Is it integrated with welfare, insurance, or other govt databases? 

Do you integrate with private job portals or partners via APIs? 

Do you have single sign-on / unified citizen identity across systems? 

Shape 

Section 5 — Citizen & Employer Experience 

Is the platform mobile-first and easy for low-digital users? 

Do you offer different journeys for youth, SMEs, vulnerable groups, etc.? 

Do you have feedback loops, call center, or support workflows? 

Shape 

Section 6 — Infrastructure, Security & Reliability 

Do you have disaster recovery and backup architecture? 

Is there real-time monitoring and alerting? 

Do you have role-based access control and encryption? 

Has the system undergone security assessment or audit? 

Shape 

Section 7 — Governance & Operating Model 

Do you have a dedicated team for data quality and governance? 

Do you have analysts/researchers using this data for insights? 

Is there a defined operating model to run and improve the platform continuously? 

Shape 

🧮 Scoring (you do this silently) 

40–54 → Advanced LMIS (rare, like Korea) 

25–40 → Growing system, big potential 

10–25 → Job portal, not LMIS yet (most countries) 

<10 → Website, not a system 

Shape 

🎯 The Closing Line You Use 

Based on their answers, you say: 

“What you have today is a strong starting point, but it is currently operating as a portal. A world-class LMIS requires strengthening across data, AI, integrations, and governance. This is exactly the transformation programs we help governments execute.” 

Now you are not selling. 
You are diagnosing.
