We’ll use an Ethernet cable and RealVNC Viewer to look at the Pi’s screen from your laptop.

What you’ll need:
- An Ethernet cable
- Your laptop
- RealVNC Viewer installed on your laptop
- The login details we provided for the Raspberry Pi
Steps:
1. Plug in the cable
    - One end of the Ethernet cable is already connected to the Raspberry Pi.
    - Connect the other end to your internet router.
    - Make sure your laptop is on the same network (connected to the same router by Wi‑Fi or another cable).
2. Install RealVNC Viewer
    - On your laptop, download and install RealVNC Viewer: [https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/)
3. Open RealVNC Viewer and sign in to the Pi
    - Open RealVNC Viewer.
    - Enter the Raspberry Pi details and password we gave you.
    - Click Connect.
4. You’ll see the Raspberry Pi screen
    - It will look like a remote desktop (similar to AnyDesk or TeamViewer).
5. Open the DB Viewer app on the Pi
    - On the Raspberry Pi screen, open “DB Viewer” (we installed this for you).
6. View the offline data
    - In DB Viewer, you can see all the data that hasn’t synced yet.
    - Review or export what you need to share.

If something doesn’t work:
- Check the Ethernet cable is firmly plugged in on both ends.
- Make sure your laptop is connected to the same router.
- If RealVNC shows a security warning, click Continue.
- If you’re unsure about the login details, contact us.
