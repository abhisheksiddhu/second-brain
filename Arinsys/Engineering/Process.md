# Priority Definition

- Priority 0 - Blocker, fatal bugs where we have to deploy hot-fix asap to the affected environments.
- Priority 1 - Critical, high impact bugs or highly requested features, release updates by proceeding through each environment in weekly cycle.
- Priority 2 - Important, major features of the upcoming release or bugs without easy workaround, release updates by proceeding through each environment in monthly cycle.
- Priority 3 - Medium, minor features of the upcoming release or minor bugs which have an easy workaround available in all environments.
- Priority 4 - Nice to have, low priority features or corner case bugs, focus on them after the priority items get completed.
- Priority 5 - Backlog, ideas we are still exploring or in early stages of technical feasibility.
- Priority 6 - Deprioritized, features which have no customer demand, or doesn't add any meaningful value to the product.
