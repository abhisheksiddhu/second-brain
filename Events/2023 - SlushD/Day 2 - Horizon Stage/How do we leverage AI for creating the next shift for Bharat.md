- unskilled workforce is higher than skilled, challenge of upskilling
- data labelling at the core
- example - village workers send pregnant women below hemoglobin 10, due to lack of medical infrastructure, data for patients in 8-10 range are fuzzed up above 10 making data not fully reliable
- information asymmetry due to language barriers
- focus on quality of data
- example - shift from yahoo to Gmail helped google improve their spam detection
- wealth generation is critical to be balanced
- ASR performance not same for male's vs females adding another layer of challenges in adoption
- Africa also has the diversity but being divide, doesn't have the skill and control
