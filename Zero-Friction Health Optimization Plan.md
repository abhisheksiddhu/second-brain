## Week 1-2: Foundation Phase (3 Core Micro-Habits)

### Habit 1: Strategic Light Exposure (Uses Existing Routine)

**What**: Optimize circadian signals within your current schedule **When & How**:

- **Morning (11:45 AM - returning from drop-off)**: Sit by brightest window for 2-3 minutes while checking phone/social media
- **Evening (during walk 12-12:30 AM)**: If area is well-lit, no additional light needed. If dark, use minimal lighting and avoid looking directly at bright lights
- **Weekend mornings**: Get direct sunlight for 5-10 minutes when you naturally wake up

**Why**: Helps reset your circadian rhythm closer to your natural pattern while working within constraints

### Habit 2: Recovery Breathing (During Existing Lie-Down Times)

**What**: 4-7-8 breathing pattern for nervous system recovery **When & How**:

- **8-9 AM lie-down**: Do 4 cycles of 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8)
- **Option during 9:45 AM-12 PM lie-down**: Same pattern if you wake up naturally
- **Before sleep scrolling**: 4 cycles before picking up phone

**Why**: Activates parasympathetic nervous system, reduces cortisol, improves recovery capacity

### Habit 3: Caffeine Timing Optimization

**What**: Align caffeine with natural cortisol rhythm **When & How**:

- **Current**: Caffeine during focus zone (3-3:30 PM onwards) ✓
- **Adjustment**: Last coffee by 6 PM max (2.5 hours before client call)
- **Tea transition**: Order chamomile tea bags for post-dinner routine

**Why**: Prevents caffeine from interfering with sleep quality while maintaining focus benefits

## Week 3-4: Optimization Phase (Building on Foundation)

### Addition A: Sleep Architecture Improvement

**What**: Enhance sleep quality within your time constraints **When & How**:

- **Tea routine**: Chamomile tea during dinner heating (10 PM) - steep while heating food
- **Screen optimization**: Switch phone to night mode by 11 PM (when you start scrolling before sleep)
- **Temperature**: Keep room slightly cool, light blanket (no extra effort)

### Addition B: Micro-Movement Integration

**What**: Address muscle pain and build movement tolerance **When & How**:

- **During calls**: Stand/pace during 12:30 PM call (you're already at home)
- **Focus breaks**: 30-second shoulder rolls between work sessions
- **Weekend**: 10-minute morning movement when you naturally wake up

### Addition C: Meal Timing Micro-Adjustment

**What**: Optimize energy stability **When & How**:

- **Lunch timing**: Eat by 3 PM max (before focus zone)
- **Evening snack**: Light snack around 7 PM if hungry (before client call)
- **Dinner**: Same timing (10:30 PM) but lighter portions

## Month 2+: Advanced Integration

### Phase 1: Tea Expansion (Month 2)

- **Morning**: Green tea during 11:45 AM-12:30 PM window (instead of coffee)
- **Afternoon**: Keep coffee for focus zone
- **Evening**: Chamomile rotation with other calming teas (chamomile, passionflower, lemon balm)

### Phase 2: Weekend Recovery Maximization (Month 2-3)

- **Natural wake-up**: Use weekends for full recovery sleep
- **Morning sunlight**: 10-15 minutes outdoor time
- **Gentle movement**: Swimming when possible, or simple stretching

### Phase 3: Stress Response Optimization (Month 3+)

- **Breathing protocols**: Expand to longer sessions during natural breaks
- **Cold exposure**: Cool showers (2-3 minutes) when energy allows
- **Heat therapy**: Warm bath/shower before bed (winters)

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1: Choose ONE habit only

- Start with Recovery Breathing (easiest to implement)
- Do it during existing lie-down times
- No pressure on perfection

### Week 2: Add Light Exposure

- Simply sit by window when returning from drop-off
- Continue breathing practice
- Note energy changes

### Week 3-4: Add Caffeine Optimization

- Order chamomile tea bags
- Set 6 PM coffee cutoff
- Begin evening tea routine

## Success Metrics (Check Monthly)

### Energy Indicators

- Reduced afternoon crashes
- Better focus during work hours
- Less muscle pain with movement

### Sleep Quality

- Feeling more rested on weekends
- Easier time falling asleep
- Less grogginess during morning yoga

### Stress Response

- Better mood stability
- Reduced anxiety/overwhelm
- Improved recovery from stressful days

## Troubleshooting

### If Habits Don't Stick:

- Reduce to smaller version (2 breathing cycles instead of 4)
- Attach to existing routines more firmly
- Focus on one habit for 2 weeks before adding next

### If No Improvement After Month 1:

- Assess which habits are actually happening
- Check sleep environment factors
- Consider whether partner's anxiety support might be needed

### If Muscle Pain Persists:

- Check vitamin D levels (common with limited sun exposure)
- Ensure adequate protein at meals
- Consider magnesium supplementation

## Tea Shopping List

- Chamomile tea bags (30-pack)
- Green tea bags (30-pack)
- Passionflower tea bags (optional month 2)
- Lemon balm tea bags (optional month 2)

## The Zero-Friction Principle

Every habit uses time/actions you're already doing:

- Breathing → during existing lie-down time
- Light exposure → during phone checking/drop-off routine
- Tea → same effort as coffee, different timing
- Movement → during existing calls/breaks

**No extra time required. No schedule changes. Maximum impact through optimization of existing patterns.**
