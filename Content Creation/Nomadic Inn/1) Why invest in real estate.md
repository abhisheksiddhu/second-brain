Most of us have heard of warren buffet, the world's most respected investor, and his first rule of investing is to 'always protect your money', and 2nd rule is 'to never forget the rule 1', but most of the times people play it too safe and as a result are never able to create wealth for them

So what all options are available to us in terms of investments,

well for the low risk option we can keep our money in a Savings Bank account. Then we have fixed and recurring bank deposits, there are many corporate fixed deposits as well, then there are many other options in this category like PPF, EPF, pension, post office bonds etc. , but the problem with these investment options is that they don't give you enough returns to beat inflation and even if it does in some cases it doesn't beat by enough margin with the time it takes, which is why I actually don't call them investments and rather as ways to protect your money

and on the higher risk side we have options like stocks, mutual funds, commodities, foreign currency  and other such things which can be traded, commonly in a exchange when you are trading at scale, but you can do individual trading as well.

now unless you have been living under a rock in the last 3 months, I am sure you must have heard about bitcoin and it's soaring prices, but I must tell you that bitcoin at present is extremely volatile and a small mistake or overlook of the conceptual understanding of how bitcoin and other crypto currencies for that matter works, can make you loose a major portion of your money,

Now I will be honest here and I will tell you that even I did bitcoin trading and made 10% profit on my original investment in just a few days, but around a week later it crashed around 40% of it's then price, you guys hear that right, 40 %, that is roughly half of the money, and let me tell you that while I pulled the trigger on the right time and saved my money, and made a good profit, there are many people who lost their money

There are primarily two ways to get returns from our investments - one is getting appreciation or interest , and the other is to get a regular cash flow. We can have a fixed deposit wherein it gives us the interest on a regular basis and returns the original principal on maturity, or get the whole interest and principal on maturity, similarly some stocks do give cash flow in terms of dividends, and most of the trading is done for profit on sale of the stocks, commodity or whatever you invested in.

Now coming to real estate, it kind of gives us the best of all worlds 1) our money is secured since we have the property, 2) if held for enough time, it's price will only go up, now there might be a few cases when the prices may not increase because of demand at that particular time, but give it some time and the market will re-correct itself, that's why I said if held for enough time and 3) it gives you regular cash flow in the form of rent, and on top of it, rent gets higher as time goes by, giving you even higher cash flow with time

With all that said we come to an end for this video, so thanks for watching everyone. Please like, dislike or leave a comment for any suggestion and don't forget to subscribe.  Take Care.. Good bye!
