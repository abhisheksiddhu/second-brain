Hi,

I am an organizer for a .NET Developers meetup group ([https://meetup.com/NCR-NET-Developers/](https://meetup.com/NCR-NET-Developers/)) here in India and we have virtual meetups every second Saturday of the month. Just wanted to ask if you would be interested in giving a talk to our group in the upcoming meetup.
