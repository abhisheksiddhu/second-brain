Emil:

"Hey Evan! I have been watching your videos for a while now. Hope you enjoyed your trip to Asia! I am enthusiastic about entrepreneur videos. I have searched on Youtube and Google and I always get videos/articles about what to do. I believe knowing what NOT to do is equally important. Usually, all I get is generic tips such as "dont grow too fast" but there are no concrete case studies. But when it comes to successful stories, there are specific examples we can learn from. I was thinking if maybe you can have videos/articles analysing and explaining how some real businesses failed, especially start ups. It would be great if you can use your influence to encourage entrepreneurs who have failed to share their stories with you. That way, the mistake will only be made by once because we all will have learnt from it  Hopefully you'll consider my suggestion"

On episode 278 of the #AskGaryVee Show, I go solo and talk about:

- How to keep your head above water while going all in on your passion

- Whether or not to choose retirement and financial stability over your passion and time with family

#QUESTIONS:

2:20 - I just went "all in" on creating music and have been receiving a lot of criticism from my parents and other people in my life - how do I keep my head above water and survive this both emotionally and financially?

16:41 - I am serving in the United States Marine Corps and am thinking about staying for another 10 years to collect retirement benefits, but at the same time, I'm wondering if I should leave early and go home to work on my own business so that I can spend more time with my family? What should I do and how should I look at this?

Should you work Harder?

Is hard work the key?  Is hustle the key?

Is the answer to work harder or to work smarter? Because there is a difference.

Activity doesn't mean achievement.

The people that get ahead are not just grinders. The grind is necessary, but it's never the goal. The goal in life is to breathe and enjoy life.

Today I'm going to share with you all of my war stories about getting banned by Google. ►►Subscribe here to learn more of my secret SEO tips: [https://goo.gl/ScRTwc](https://goo.gl/ScRTwc)

Read more on my blog: [https://neilpatel.com/blog](https://neilpatel.com/blog)

These are the top SEO mistakes to avoid, and if you don't, you're going to get banned.

Tip #1: Avoid building links through WordPress themes.

Some people are still doing them, and they think it works.

Back in the day, I had a web hosting website. I never provided web hosting, but, I ranked number one on Google for the term web hosting.

That's one of the most competitive terms.

Everyone's going after it because they want affiliate commissions for HostGator, Bluehost, GoDaddy.

You name it.

Instead of creating my own themes I bought domains that had hosting in it or the term web hosting and then bought a ton of WordPress themes.

I bought all the popular WordPress themes that were already out there and got them for little to no money.

Within six months I shot off to the page of Google for the term web hosting.

Within another three months, I shot up to the first spot.

And you know what happened?

Google eventually banned the website.

When I was ranking number one, I was generating over a $100,000 a month in affiliate income.

That was great.

I didn't even spend more than $50,000 buying a ton of these sites, and I did that over a period of six months.

So the income that I was generating was massive compared to my investment.

But I got banned. 

I learned, don't do shady link affiliate tactics.

Tip #2: Avoid expired domain names.

There was a domain named after a park, and I bought it because it was about the civil war in America and it had a bunch of  EDU links.

All I did was to a take ancient domain name that had a ton of authority and change it to casino-related stuff, and, boom, I popped up in the top three spots for the key term "online casino" and "casino."

That's crazy, right?

Eventually, Google figured it out, got banned, lost all my money.

I stopped using those tactics because it's not good in the long run.

If you're not sure if you're SEO strategy that you're using is going to get you banned or not, leave a comment, and I'll tell you if you should be doing more of it or less of it.

The last thing you want to do is put all this time and energy like I did and then get banned.

Think long term.

Tip #3: Avoid writing the same content over and over again.

After a while, you run out of topics to produce. So you just regurgitate the same stuff over and over again.

Instead, what you should be doing is updating your old content and changing it to 2017 to 2018 and making the tools more thorough.

Delete the old ones that no one uses anymore.

In your blog, you probably already have regurgitated content, so go into your Google Analytics, look at the one that gets the least amount of search topic, and redirect to more popular topics.

Combine the content, make it more thorough, you have less duplicate content and take all your old material that's bad and no one's reading anymore, and delete it.

When you do that, you're going to get way more traffic, you're not going to get penalized, and it's going to grow quarter over quarter continually.

Avoid these three SEO mistakes and in the long run when you measure your growth, year over year, you should be going up.

Think long-term, and stay away from short-term tricks and tactics like I was doing.

It's about longevity. Follow these tips, and you will have longevity.

Tom answers questions from the community.

Health Theory is now LIVE!!: [http://bit.ly/2F5cRi0](http://bit.ly/2F5cRi0)

Tom Bilyeu AMA’s are Live on Facebook and YouTube every Friday at 10 am PST.

You can submit your questions in advance to connect@impacttheory.com, with the subject line “AMA Question”.

BOOKS MENTIONED:

Principles by Ray Dalio: [http://amzn.to/2CqRQIn](http://amzn.to/2CqRQIn)

QUESTIONS

Robyn Bautista: “Hi Tom, I’m 29 years old, and am barely beginning to learn about growth mindset and taking ownership. I find myself getting distraught about where I am in life and question what I want to move towards. I feel so behind and find myself getting angry over the choices I’ve made and not having knowledge sooner. I’m afraid I’m too old to change. What advice do you have for me and how do I move out of this space?” [2:15]

Darsh: “I have an extreme daily routine where i wake up early (2:30 am) and take cold showers by 3:30 am. I’m studying for upcoming exams and have done this routine for around 2 months and am beginning to get fed up of it - also grades haven’t improved much from where they were before my extreme routine, so parents think that it holds no value. What can I do in order to carry on this rather brutal process without getting fed up and continue to love learning?” [5:10]

George Griffeth: "How often do you feel unmotivated with your production company? Do you ever feel like it isn't going to get where you want it to?" [7:34]

Hessy Williams; "How do you respond when the Matrix tries to draw you back in?” [11:40]

Saurabh Jadhav: "Why do so many people feel They Are "Behind" in whatever they are achieving? There must be some reason...can you give us small explanation please?" [14:40]

Natalie Tellish: "It's no secret that the American education system is outdated. What sorts of things do you think should be incorporated to the education of today's children? What concepts or courses do you think are obsolete and can be completely removed? [16:30]

Jacques Botha: "Hi Tom, I'm a nice guy with all the nice guy tendencies and find that people talk over me in group conversations how do I make myself heard? Without being an A**hole?" [18:13]

Dayna N Anthony Mott: "I finished Principles by Ray Dalio. I have an organization slightly different than a traditional structure. How did you initially introduce the concepts to your team? What obstacles did you face? I want to implement right away." [22:32]

Crafty B: "Tom! I'm a lazy ass but I desperately want to have self-discipline how can I start to build up self-discipline and how can I keep it up, and not go back to my lazy tendencies?" [26:19]

Jose Gabriel Gonzalez: "Tom, how did your life’s mission evolve over time to the point at which it is now? Did you just wake up one day with the idea of building a studio that would get people out of the matrix or did you slowly polish the idea over time? How did the process look like for you?" [30:06]

Amanda Coffey: "I’m having concerns with positive thinking and affirmations. So I’m in the process of changing my thoughts to positive ones. I’ve found myself worried about some music I listen too. Example: “bad at love” lyric. Can music cross over to our subconscious thoughts?" [33:09]

Will Collette: "Our unit likes to solve problems with meetings. I'm in at least one a day, and they take at least an hour (I hate them). What's your advice to get rid of these (they often don't result in productive action), and solve problems another way?" [35:01]

Lerone Graham : "Tom! With all of the books you read, how do you balance between implementing the principles and getting bogged down with analysis paralysis?" [37:25]

Emanuele Venturini: "Hi Tom, I have a passion for musical composition and I find really hard to picture a future where my passion will allow me to make the money I need to live.. How would you handle this situation?" [38:23]

David Gomes: "Tom, how to manage returning to the habit of going to bed early, considering I go out at night every other friday?" [40:10]

Lindsey Schutze: "Hey Tom, I find myself feeling intimidated by talking with others who are much more intellectual than I am. Despite that, I’m trying to pitch in where I can, knowing I can learn. What is a good question to ask others to learn from them and open the door for almost mentorship kinds of discussions?" [41:36]

VOCALS:  Chris Record

VIDEO:  Sam Servidio

BEAT:  Sam LoBue

BOSS LIFE LYRICS:

Focused on my business

BossLyfe Tecademics

Tracking progress like fit bit

Got this office and we killin it.

Lifestyle is Limitless

Got love for life and we

live for this

Teaching everybody

Structured education

With a class and a syllabus

Gift of gab is Ridiculous .

When I flip the raps

like a gymnast

Magnificent.

When I'm up in the mix

The beat drops and it HITS

With the quickness

Loving the game

Cuz I am developin

Every day

Im focused on Killin it

Back in the days

When I was craze

Livin the life of

graffiti and felonies

VERSE 2

I will go back

Every now and again

I'll look at my life and

How Bad I had been

I narrowly made it away

From the life with my friends

Several up in the pin

And several Off on a binge

With a syringe

Living up Under a bridge

Friends Had given their life for their friends

And Never were given a chance 

No wonder they never advanced

Hopping Up Over The Fence

Running away from the cops

Tagging my name on the spots

Doing it all for the props

Like I'm a boss

We got the city on lock

Climbing up over the rocks

Painting my name with the tops

All without giving a thought

Living the life of a hustler uhhhh

until I got caught

VERSE 3

check to check and

cash advance

Section 8 and

Food stamps

Skateboards and

baggy pants

Big respect and

beat up vans

Fat caps and

krylon cans

Taggin walls and

tall cans

Drink until we

can't stand

Wake up do it

all again

Trying just to

Be the man

So I need a

Bigger plan

Stuck up in this

quicksand

Looking for a

fix damn

Feeling like a

failure

But when you gotta

big dream

You can break

Through anything

Go pursue

Your destiny

Here in the moment I'm

Feelin it now

I feel like a trigger went pow

I feel I can figure it out

I Look at my life as a game

And I'm leveling up

When the haters

keep tearing me down

I'm beating em now

I'm reading a book every day

With the power to

Take over cowardly

Thoughts in my mind

I'm filling em right

With a voice up inside

Reminding me why

Then I visualize

Living A beautiful life

Never been governed by time

Traveling off in Dubai

I'm up in the sky

Feeling invincible

I am Willing to sacrifice

Working by day

And then learning by night

Taking my pay

and then saving it right

Following up with a plan

To make it expand

And make it up out of this grind

Make it up out of this grind

Investing it back in my mind

VERSE 4

Life is not a dress rehearsal

Gotta keep it simple

Because life is controversial

Traveling a road pave with

Failure and reversal

Dedications crucial

When you're

Building out your future

People talk trash

Try to tell you that you're worthless

Chasing down a dream

So big it makes you nervous

Motivation comes when you

Finally find your purpose

hate is always greater when you're

Breaking through the surface

So everyday I'm

Focused on the hustle

Must embrace the struggle

It's Like building up a muscle

Your mind is like a temple

It's like building up a castle

Life is never simple

When you're painting your

Picasso

Mentally I'm mentored by these

Beats and instrumentals

Motivation comes from

enemies who seek to insult

Lyrically I'm lifted by these

Words of individuals

Spiritually I'm gifted by this

Recent surge of influence...
