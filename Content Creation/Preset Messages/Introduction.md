Hello Everyone,
I'm Abhishek Siddhu, from Noida. I'm an engineering manager with experience across development, architecture design, delivery management, mentorship, and end-user interaction. Starting professionally in 2011, I have been building and delivering Enterprise Web & Mobile Apps with responsibilities across the entire stack including User Interface (Mobile, Desktop, Web), REST APIs, Cloud, DevOps, and Application Security.

I’ve always been an early adopter of bleeding-edge technologies, where I have done everything wrong first so that you don't have to.

I'm here to expand my network and connect with like minded people.
